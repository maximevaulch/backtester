Strategy Blueprint: Price Reach (strategy_PR)
Document Purpose: This document defines the entry and stop loss logic for the "Price Reach" trading strategy.
Part 1: Core Definitions
Timeframe: 15-minute candles.
Timezone: America/New_York for all session timings.
Session Filter: The strategy is only active during a user-defined time window (e.g., 08:00 to 12:00). If no window is provided, it is active 24h.
Part 2: Entry Logic (Signal Candle Conditions)
A signal is generated if a single 15-minute candle meets ALL THREE of the following conditions:
Pattern Condition: The candle's high is greater than or equal to (>=) the previous candle's high, AND its low is less than or equal to (<=) the previous candle's low.
Volume Condition: The volume of the candle is strictly greater than (>) the volume of the previous candle.
Body Condition: The close of the candle is NOT strictly between the previous candle's open and close.
A LONG Signal is generated if the valid signal candle is bullish (close > open).
A SHORT Signal is generated if the valid signal candle is bearish (close < open).
Part 3: Stop Loss Logic
The Stop Loss is defined by the structure of the signal candle itself.
Entry Price: The close of the valid signal candle.
Stop Loss Price (for a LONG trade): The low of the valid signal candle.
Stop Loss Price (for a SHORT trade): The high of the valid signal candle.
